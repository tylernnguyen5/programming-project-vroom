# Vroom - Capstone Programming Project at RMIT 2019

This is a full-stack project that my team of 4 have completed in semester 2 2019 at RMIT. We've done extensive documentations for this projects and applied Scrum methodology with a variation of Kanban Board approach.

We did 4-sprint iteration with the last sprint only for testing, refactoring, polisihing the code for final release and documentation for the whole project, which spanned for 8 weeks in total.

## Requirements

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application for a car share scheme. As the business owns a number of cars for rent located around the CBD, the project is intended to provide features of the system to allow their customers to look up and book for a car, handle transactions and data management which makes the business more structured, convenient and expandable. 

The ideal application should be easy to use, robust and well-designed. In the end, the application should meet the requirements as follows:

- To provide a platform where the customer can see the list of cars and choose a car to be rent.
- To let the customer book the car they want and proceed with the payment.
- To let the customer, keep track of their booking and edit the booking information.
